This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Time-based User Session using React.justify

This is a demo ReactJS project that implements time-based (transient) sessions.

## Note

Both I (the developer) and this README believe that you have NodeJS (at least version 14.5) and npm (at least 6.9.0) installed and that you have it in PATH...

## Requirements for Windows

1. Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (preferably Windows 10 Pro 21H1 64 bit)
2. NodeJS
3. Visual Studio Code

## How to Install and Run

1. Clone this repo in CLI (command-line) by using the `git clone` command.

2. Next, change into the directory of this app by running `cd time-session-app`.

3. Then from the project directory, run `npm install`. This will install the necessary JavaScript packages to make this project work. This may take some time depending on the specs of your local machine.

4. Finally, run `npm start`. This will run the application and start the development server locally (on your machine).

5. When the development server is up and running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view this app.

## Fair Warning

Please note that the session in this app has been set to 30 minutes per session, so you would have to exercise patience. You should grab a soda and a slice of pizza :)

That's it... You're done!
